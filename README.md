# Amplify Toolhead
A Voron toolhead with integrated load cell.

## FAQ

### Accuracy:
- Down to the Micron
- Competitive with Voron Tap
- Reliable with only a single probe point
- No more Z offset adjustments ever again

### Force applied to the bed:
- 5g to 100g depending on the probing speed
- Low enough force to use on cantilever and PCB beds

### Compatibility:
- Voron 0, Trident, 2.4, and Switchwire
- RatRig V-Core 3/4, probably.

### Software:
- Native Klipper integration, no plugins required!
- [TBC] Live sensor data available in Mainsail/Fluidd
- [TBC] Clog detection

### Hardware:
- Entirely custom toolhead PCB using STM32G0
- Rated to 80C operating temperature
- Possibility for a “pro” version rated to 110C, with a fancier ADC
- Fully Open Source Hardware

### Amplify Probe:
- Standalone ADC module for custom toolheads
- Maybe? Depending on demand

When:
- Soon™
